# example block game
A simple open source block game to show a working implementation of my block game engine

Powered by [Lua](https://www.lua.org/about.html) and [Love2D](https://love2d.org/)

### ok cool how do I play
If you want something that works, go to [the releases page](https://github.com/Oshisaure/example-block-game/releases) and get the build for your platform.  
If you are on linux you get the appropriate [Love2D build](https://github.com/love2d/love/releases/tag/11.3) for your distro, and run the .love file from the latest example block game release with it.  

However if you would rather be up to date with all the lastest tiniest changes that may or may not function you can clone the repository and follow [these instructions](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started) to set it up.  
Be careful though because I may be dumb and render the whole thing unusable sometimes due to being bad at programming.

### do you mind if I mod this?
No, this is open source for a reason. Go ahead and fork this to your heart's contents, as long as you keep in mind the license.  
Although do keep in mind that I am still working on this so things like score system, sound effects and more settings will be in this at some point.
